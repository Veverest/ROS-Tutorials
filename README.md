# ROS-Tutorials
ROS Tutorials in a task-centric course. Tasks organised in a methodical weekly arrangement like Coursera, but without the professional touch. Perfect, right? 

1. The length of the course is **n** weeks, divided into tasks. 
2. For better help with the course, raise an issue on this repository, so that others can see your question and it'll prevent any replicated effort. All discussions related to code will happen over issues.
3. All your code will be pushed to GitHub, so if you haven't already, create a GitHub account. Create a **private** repository with the name: `ros-tutorials` and add @veverest as a collaborator. 
4. Create a `README.md` in your repository where you can keep track of your progress over the next month. 

## Prerequisites
1. OS: Either some Linux based OS (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.) OR Mac OSX. Windows
  will not suffice. [Tutorial for installing Ubuntu](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-install-ubuntu-desktop).
2. Language: We'll be using Python3, C++, XML throughout this course. So familiarise yourself with the languages.
3. ROS:  [Installation for ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)
4. Visual Studio Code: Install the text editor based on your OS. 
5. Git: You'll be using GitHub for all your code/assignment submission, so learn the basics.  [Tutorial for git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials)

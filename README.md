# ROS-Tutorials
ROS Tutorials in a task-centric course. Tasks organised in a methodical weekly arrangement like Coursera, but without the professional touch. Perfect, right? 

1. The length of the course is **n** weeks, divided into tasks. 
2. For better help with the course, raise an issue on this repository, so that others can see your question and it'll prevent any replicated effort. All discussions related to code will happen over issues.
3. All your code will be pushed to GitHub, so if you haven't already, create a GitHub account. Create a **private** repository with the name: `ros-tutorials` and add @veverest as a collaborator. 
4. Create a `README.md` in your repository where you can keep track of your progress over the next month. 

## Prerequisites
1. OS: Either some Linux based OS (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.) OR Mac OSX. Windows
  will not suffice. [Tutorial for installing Ubuntu](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-install-ubuntu-desktop).
2. Language: We'll be using Python3, C++, XML throughout this course. So familiarise yourself with the languages.
3. ROS:  [Installation for ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)
4. Visual Studio Code: Install the text editor based on your OS. 
5. Git: You'll be using GitHub for all your code/assignment submission, so learn the basics.  [Tutorial for git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials)

## Task 0 
1. Create a ros workspace from the tutorials. Find out what each file and folder is for. 
2. Create the private Github repository using git and go through tutorials given. 
3. Add a progress section in the README of the repository and keep tabs on your work, date-wise. 
4. For doubts or issues, refer to the internet and include a note in the ISSUES section of the ReadMe. 

## Task 1
1. Create a ROS package for simple publisher subscriber. 
2. Write a publisher and subscriber in python and C++ and figure out what each line does. '
3. Send different types of data, select different names for topics and see how the files can be executed. 
4. Include in progress list (again, date wise) and issues whenever you feel the need.
